        <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
        <p>
          I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the position at
          your company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having completed the Digital Shapers Certificate in Front-End
          Development from TechLabs Berlin in the spring 2023, I am equipped
          with a strong foundation in React, npm, JavaScript, Git, HTML, and CSS
          (including frameworks such as Bootstrap, MUI and Tailwind). Through
          intensive training and the development of three unique projects, I
          have showcased my ability to build and maintain complex codebases. You
          can find examples of my work directly on

          <a href="https://github.com/JoannaKowalik">Github</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following completion of the TechLabs course, I was invited to join
          their volunteer team, where I actively contributed to creating
          branding, visuals, and the organization's new website using
          TypeScript, NextJS, yarn, Figma and Canva. This experience has further
          strengthened my technical abilities and passion for creating
          exceptional digital experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          My background in architecture, with seven years of experience in the
          field, has provided me with a keen eye for aesthetics, meticulous
          attention to detail, and excellent project management skills using
          Asana and Kanban boards. From 2017 until spring 2023 I have been
          active as a freelancer, which helped me polish my organizational
          skills and ability to manage multiple, client-centered projects
          simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, I am confident in my ability to collaborate effectively
          with cross- functional teams, gather requirements, and communicate in
          a pracise yet friendly manner. I am a great team player, always eager
          to learn and contribute, and a fun person to be around. I addition, I
          am currently enrolled in a Higher Diploma course in Software
          Development at National College of Ireland, with the graduation date
          in spring 2026. I believe that my skills, combined with my dedication
          and love for learning, make me an ideal candidate for the role.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am confident that my passion for coding, combined with my skills and
          enthusiasm, will greatly contribute to your company's goals. Should
          you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact
          me.
        </p>
        <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
        <p>Joanna Kowalik</p>
